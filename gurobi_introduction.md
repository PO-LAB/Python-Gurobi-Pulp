# Gurobi Introduction

[Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/), also known as Gurobi Optimizer, is an optimization engine used for solving mathematical programming problems. It is one of the well-known mathematical programming optimizers in the market. It was primarily developed by [Zonghao **Gu**, Edward  **Ro**thberg, Robert **Bi**xby](https://www.gurobi.com/company/our-team/), and the name "Gurobi" is derived from the first two letters of each developer's last name.

### :black_nib: Supported Mathematical Programming Types [:link:](http://www.gurobi.com/products/features-benefits)
Gurobi can solve the following types of mathematical programming problems:
<br>

- Linear Programming (LP)
- Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
- Quadratic Programming (QP)
- Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP)
- Quadratically Constrained Programming (QCP)
- Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming (MIQCP)

:zap: Gurobi can handle non-linear problems as well, but only limited to quadratic programming problems.

### :black_nib: License
To use Gurobi, you need to obtain a [Gurobi License](http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/licenses/license-center). Gurobi licenses come in two main types: [Commercial Licenses](https://portal.gurobi.com/iam/licenses/request?type=commercial) and [Academic Licenses](https://portal.gurobi.com/iam/licenses/request) Commercial licenses require payment, but Gurobi offers a trial license for companies to evaluate its use. Academic licenses are completely free and have no restrictions on the size of models or functionality. However, academic licenses are valid for one year, and you must reapply for a new license once it expires. Overall, Gurobi is a generous mathematical programming solver, especially for academic use.
